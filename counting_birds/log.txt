Training the model with Tikhonov regularization:
--------------
Tikhonov regularization is used.
Non-negative feature encoding assumed. w is constrained to be non-negative.
Starting iteration 1

Minimum found that satisfies the constraints.

Optimization completed because the objective function is non-decreasing in 
feasible directions, to within the value of the optimality tolerance,
and constraints are satisfied to within the value of the constraint tolerance.
